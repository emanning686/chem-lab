This repository contains all of my work in [Dr. Paul Craig's](https://github.com/paulcraig) cheminformatics lab at RIT during the spring semester of 2024-25.
My goal was to explore machine learning concepts within the bio & chem informatics sphere in order to create useful notebooks for others engaging in this research in the lab and beyond.
